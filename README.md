# Getting and Cleaning Data
## Course Project

This repository it's destinated to host my project of the "Getting and Cleaning Data" course project 
in the "Data Science" specialization offered through coursera.

It contains only one script : run_analysis.R. 

### Script instructions and prerrequisites.

1. It is neccesary an internet connection as the script downloads the required datasets from the web.
2. Besides the internet connection ,the script can be run without any special instructions by the normal R scripts running processes (from R studio or with RScript). 
3. When the script finishes , it will give it's output as a tidy dataset named "means_dataset.txt" in the working directory.
